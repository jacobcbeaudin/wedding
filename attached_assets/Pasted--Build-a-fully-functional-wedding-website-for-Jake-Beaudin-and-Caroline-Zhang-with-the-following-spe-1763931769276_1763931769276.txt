     - Enter names of additional guests if bringing plus-ones
   - Single food allergies/dietary restrictions field that applies to their entire party

   - Fun facts about Jake and Caroline
   - "How We Met" story
   - Favorite things, proposal story, etc.

**DESIGN REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL):**
- **Aesthetic:** Retro 90s Geocities vibe - ironic, nostalgic, intentionally kitsch

- **Color Scheme:** Dusty blue (#9FB4C7 or similar palette) as dominant color with 90s accent colors (hot pink, lime green, etc.)
- **Custom Cursor:** Pixelated otter cursor throughout site (create pixel art or use existing)

  - "Under construction" aesthetic elements
  - Rainbow horizontal dividers
  - Guestbook-style RSVP form
  - Visitor hit counter (functional or decorative)

  - Blinking text (sparingly)
  - Comic sans everywhere

**TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:**

- Form validation for RSVP
- Backend with Node.js/Express and database (SQLite or JSON storage)
- Admin panel with password protection to:
  - Add/edit guest list

**DATA STRUCTURE EXAMPLE:**
```javascript
// Guest record example
{
  id: 1,
  name: "John Smith",
  invitationCode: "JS2026",
  email: "john@email.com",
  invitedTo: ["tea_ceremony", "welcome_party", "wedding_ceremony"],
  plusOnes: 1,
  rsvp: {
    tea_ceremony: { attending: true, guestCount: 2, guestNames: ["Jane Smith"] },
    welcome_party: { attending: true, guestCount: 2 },
    wedding_ceremony: { attending: true, guestCount: 2 },
    foodAllergies: "Shellfish, gluten"
  }
}
```

Make it functional, user-friendly, and genuinely capture that ironic 90s internet aesthetic. The RSVP system is the most critical feature - it must handle multiple events and personalized guest invitations seamlessly.
